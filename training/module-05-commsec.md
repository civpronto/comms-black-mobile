  <h2>📡 1. What COMMSEC Covers</h2>
  <p>
    Communications security (COMMSEC) is about protecting <strong>what you
    say</strong>, <strong>who you say it to</strong> and <strong>how that fact
    can be observed</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content: the messages, calls, files.</li>
    <li>Metadata: who talked to whom, when and how often.</li>
    <li>Identity: how a communication links back to a real person.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>💬 2. Encrypted App Suite</h2>
  <p>
    Modern encrypted messengers protect content well when used correctly, but
    they still differ in how they handle identity, backups and metadata.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer end‑to‑end encrypted apps with strong default settings.</li>
    <li>
      Disable cloud backups for sensitive chats where appropriate to reduce
      extra copies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Separate identities by device or profile rather than using one app
      account for everything.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🔑 3. PGP &amp; High‑Assurance Channels</h2>
  <p>
    PGP is still useful where long‑term integrity and authenticity matter
    (e.g. verifying that a message really came from a given key holder).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use strong, unique keys and protect private keys carefully.</li>
    <li>Keep revocation and backup plans documented and tested.</li>
    <li>Rotate keys if their use case or risk level changes substantially.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🧭 4. Behavioural Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use consistent channels for sensitive topics; avoid “channel hopping”.</li>
    <li>Do not mix high‑risk and casual chat under the same identity.</li>
    <li>
      Assume anything you send might eventually be screenshotted or forwarded;
      write accordingly.
    </li>
  </ul>
