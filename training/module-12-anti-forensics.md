  <h2>🔍 1. What Investigators Look At</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Device images: full copies of storage for later analysis.</li>
    <li>System and app logs, cached data and databases.</li>
    <li>Backups and synced copies held by cloud providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>❌ 2. Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“Incognito mode” removes traces everywhere – it does not.</li>
    <li>Deleting an app guarantees its data is gone – it may not.</li>
    <li>
      Tools marketed as “erasers” often focus on peace of mind, not proven
      guarantees.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>🛠️ 3. Practical Anti‑Forensics (Within the Rules)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use separate devices/profiles for truly high‑risk roles.</li>
    <li>Limit the number of apps and services involved in sensitive operations.</li>
    <li>
      Treat duress features as last‑resort tools and understand the legal
      context before relying on them.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>⚖️ 4. Limits &amp; Ethics</h2>
  <p>
    No anti‑forensics practice is perfect, especially against capable and
    well‑resourced adversaries. The goal is <strong>risk reduction</strong>,
    not guaranteed invisibility, and your approach should always stay within
    the law in your jurisdiction.
