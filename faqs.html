      <details open>
        <summary>Do I need a subscription?</summary>
        <p>No. Comms Black Mobile does not charge a subscription. Some features rely on third‑party providers (e.g., Silent.link for data eSIMs, Blacktel for VoIP, Starlink for satellite internet). Ongoing costs come directly from those providers.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What’s included with each communication kit?</summary>
        <p>Every kit includes a GrapheneOS phone, protective accessories, charging equipment, and, depending on the package, privacy hardware and anonymous connectivity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anonymous/Operator/Sovereign Aussie</strong>: include starter credits for data and VoIP to get you going.</li>
          <li><strong>Everyday Aussie</strong>: designed for customers using their own SIM.</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>How do I recharge data or VoIP credit?</summary>
        <p>Recharge directly through the provider (Silent.link / Blacktel / Starlink). We can guide you through the process or handle it if you provide funds.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How much do ongoing services cost?</summary>
        <p>Prices change over time. Expect roughly market rates for data eSIMs, VoIP numbers, and satellite plans. We’ll provide current rates during ordering.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I use my own SIM card?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Everyday Aussie is designed for your own SIM. Other kits can also use your SIM, though some privacy features rely on anonymous eSIMs.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is GrapheneOS difficult to use?</summary>
        <p>No. It feels familiar if you’ve used Android. The difference is hardened security and more control.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>What support do you provide?</summary>
        <p>We’ll help with setup, using your kit, and managing providers. You’ll always know how to recharge data, VoIP or satellite services.</p>
