  <h2>🧱 1. Why Compartmentalise?</h2>
  <p>
    Compartments prevent one incident from exposing everything. Each
    compartment is a slice of your digital life with its own devices,
    accounts and behaviours.

  <h2>🗂️ 2. Types of Compartments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal – your everyday identity and relationships.</li>
    <li>Work – employer data, colleagues, professional tools.</li>
    <li>Project/role – specific investigations or campaigns.</li>
    <li>Burner – tightly scoped, short‑lived activities.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🚧 3. Avoiding Cross‑Contamination</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not reuse login details or recovery email/phone between roles.</li>
    <li>Do not move files between compartments without a deliberate reason.</li>
    <li>
      Use naming and labelling that makes it obvious which device/profile you
      are using.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧭 4. Mapping to Kits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shield: personal plus work, with stronger hygiene.</li>
    <li>Shadow: specific higher‑risk roles that need separation.</li>
    <li>Ghost: short‑term, high‑risk operations with tight scope.</li>
  </ul>
