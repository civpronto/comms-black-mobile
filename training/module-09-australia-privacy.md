  <h2>🇦🇺 1. Australia in Context</h2>
  <p>
    Australia is often described as having relatively strong surveillance and
    data‑access powers compared to some other democracies. For CommsBlack
    users, the key is to understand the <strong>practical</strong> impact.

  <h2>📡 2. Local Surveillance Mechanics (High Level)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Retention of certain telecommunications metadata for set periods.</li>
    <li>
      Legal mechanisms for authorities to request data from providers under
      defined conditions.
    </li>
    <li>Device searches in specific scenarios (e.g. borders, warrants).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 3. Implications for CommsBlack Users</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Treat Shield as your “known identity” device and plan behaviour
      accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use Shadow and Ghost only where the additional friction is justified by
      risk.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remember that tools don’t override the law; the goal is to exercise your
      rights and privacy sensibly, not to obstruct legitimate investigations.
    </li>
  </ul>
