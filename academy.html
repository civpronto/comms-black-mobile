          <summary>GrapheneOS basics</summary>
          <p>GrapheneOS is an open‑source, security‑focused mobile OS based on AOSP. It’s hardened against exploits, removes bloat, and gives you granular control. Start by creating a separate owner profile, using a strong screen lock, and installing only what you need via the “Apps” client.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>VoIP & anonymous numbers</summary>
          <p>VoIP lets you call and text over the internet. Combined with privacy‑preserving providers, you can separate identity from everyday communications. Use per‑context numbers (work, travel, classifieds) and disable ID reuse.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Data security</summary>
          <p>Assume profiling on most networks. Prefer HTTPS, enable DNS‑over‑HTTPS, and keep your browser compartmentalised. Use separate profiles for sensitive tasks, and avoid mixing identities.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Air‑gapped devices</summary>
          <p>Air‑gapping means keeping a device permanently offline. For ultra‑sensitive workflows, prepare an offline device for note‑taking, crypto signing, or document viewing. Use a Faraday bag when moving it.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Faraday protection</summary>
          <p>Faraday bags block radio signals (cellular, Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, NFC). Use them when transporting devices or when you need guaranteed offline behaviour.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Satellite internet</summary>
          <p>Satellite connectivity (e.g., Starlink) gives you coverage in remote areas or as a censorship fallback. Combine with a privacy router to avoid SIM identity leakage.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Monero (XMR)</summary>
          <p>Monero focuses on privacy by default with ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions. Treat wallets like keys — back them up and keep seed phrases offline.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>OPSEC</summary>
          <p>Operational security is about protecting your plans and patterns. Separate identities, control information exposure, and keep communication channels compartmentalised.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>COMSEC</summary>
          <p>Communications security keeps messages private and authentic. Prefer end‑to‑end encryption, verify safety numbers, and keep devices updated.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Countersurveillance</summary>
          <p>Understand likely threats, observe your environment, and reduce metadata. When in doubt, simplify and reduce your attack surface.</p>
