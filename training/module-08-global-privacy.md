  <h2>🌍 1. Global Digital Freedom Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Around the world, states differ in how they regulate speech, access to
    information and surveillance. Some environments are relatively open;
    others impose tight controls on networks and platforms.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>📜 2. Surveillance Powers (High Level)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data retention laws for telecoms and internet providers.</li>
    <li>Interception and monitoring powers with varying oversight.</li>
    <li>Cross‑border data‑sharing agreements.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>📚 3. Case‑Study Thinking</h2>
  <p>
    Rather than memorising specific laws per country, focus on questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is likely to have access to which logs and metadata?</li>
    <li>What recourse exists if those powers are misused?</li>
    <li>
      How would a CommsBlack kit change the risk profile in a given example?
    </li>
  </ul>
