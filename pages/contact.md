    <section>
      <h2>General FAQs</h2>

      <h3>What does CommsBlack offer?</h3>
      <p>
        CommsBlack provides privacy-focused mobile setups, secure communication tools,
        and services designed to minimise digital footprint and increase operational privacy.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the safest way to contact you?</h3>
      <p>
        The safest and most private method is Signal using our handle
        <code>commsblack.10</code>. Email is fine for general or simple questions.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you store logs or tracking information?</h3>
      <p>
        No. We operate with strict minimal data retention: no tracking, no analytics,
        and no unnecessary logs.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I send sensitive information by email?</h3>
      <p>
        You can, but email is not private by default. For sensitive details (addresses,
        receipts, order information), we recommend using Signal, or optionally encrypting
        your email with our PGP key. If you are unsure how, just use Signal instead.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you have a phone number?</h3>
      <p>
        No. For privacy reasons, we only use secure communication channels (Signal and email).
      </p>

      <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
      <p>
        We accept <strong>XMR (Monero) only</strong>. We do not accept fiat, credit cards,
        PayPal, or other cryptocurrencies.
      </p>

      <h3>What is your refund or support policy?</h3>
      <p>
        Support and refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. For any issues, contact us
        via Signal or email and include relevant details (you may optionally encrypt them with PGP).
      </p>

      <h3>Where are you based?</h3>
      <p>
        We are based in <strong>Australia</strong> and support customers
        <strong>internationally</strong>. All communication and service delivery are handled online.
      </p>

      <h3>Are my messages kept confidential?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Signal is end-to-end encrypted, email can optionally be encrypted with PGP,
        and we do not track visitors or keep communication logs beyond what is technically necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need an account to contact you?</h3>
      <p>
        No. There is no account, login, or profile required. You can contact us anonymously
        via Signal or email.
      </p>
