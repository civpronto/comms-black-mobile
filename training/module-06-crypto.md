  <h2>💰 1. Crypto Reality Check</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency is not anonymous by default. Most major chains use public
    ledgers, meaning transactions are permanently recorded and can often be
    linked to people through exchanges, services and behaviour.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>🪙 2. Privacy‑Focused Coins</h2>
  <p>
    Privacy‑oriented cryptocurrencies aim to hide sender, receiver and/or
    amounts on‑chain. They are tools for financial privacy, not magic cloaks.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Benefits: harder for third parties to map your financial life from the
      public ledger alone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Trade‑offs: regulatory scrutiny, availability, liquidity and learning
      curve.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>👛 3. Wallet Hygiene</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Write down and secure recovery phrases offline.</li>
    <li>Use separate wallets for different roles or projects.</li>
    <li>
      Avoid mixing funds that you want to keep logically separate; once mixed,
      they can be hard to “un‑entangle”.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>📈 4. Operational Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand that on/off‑ramps (exchanges, brokers) often perform KYC.</li>
    <li>
      Document a simple, repeatable process that matches your legal obligations
      and risk tolerance.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid improvising under stress with large amounts or new tools.</li>
  </ul>
